                <a href="https://www.zumper.com">Zumper</a> is a rental marketplace company based in San Francisco that Berkeley
                <a href="http://www.codebase.berkeley.edu/">Codebase</a> reached out to work on a project for during the Fall 2018 semester.
                Our team developed a spam classification web application for Zumper employees to both feed messages on their platform through
                our machine learning models, as well as classify messages that do not reach a threshold of certainty from the models. This project's
                development was mentored by my team's project managers, Hans Zheng and Amitav Baruah. I worked most closely with Olivia Shah, Emma Chiu,
                and Trevor Aquino to create the web application portion of this project.

        <!--2. Message Classification-->
        <div class="project-section">
            <div class="subheading">
               02 | message classification
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                Each message that is shown to the user displays a content and sender field. The user presses either the <em>spam</em> or <em>not spam</em> buttons
                in order to classify what category they perceive the message to belong to. Which each press of these buttons, each message object updates the counts for the
                number of votes it received in each category.
                <br><br>
                However, in order to ensure that no single user has complete autonomy over each message's classification, there are two primary requirements that must be met
                before a message is considered classified (both of which are adjustable in a .env file based on the wants and needs of the Zumper team):
                <br>
                1) <b>Minimum number of classifers</b>: This is the number of people that must have classified a message before even considering which category it belongs to.
                <br>
                2) <b>Bias Threshold</b>: This is the percentage of bias towards one category that must be met, set as a fraction between 0 and 1. For example, if the
                bias threshold is set to be 75%, then this is the fraction of votes for a single category that must be met before a message is officially classified.
                <br>
                <em>** If a message fulfills requirement 1, but not 2, then the classification is determined by a dynamic threshold, which is explained below.</em>
                <br><br>
                Once a message is officially classified, it will no longer be seen by users that are currently classifying incoming messages; instead, they are displayed in a
                table view that is accessible via the tabs on the side bar.
            </div>

               03 | dynamic thresholds
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                For the case where a message's spam and not-spam tallies do not surpass high enough bias threshold, the threshold becomes <em>dynamic</em>,
                in which case, the minimum number of classifiers becomes a higher value, and the two requirements reset with this new "highMinClassifiers"
                value.
                <br><br>
                If the bias threshold is not reached by the time the maximum number of classifiers is met, the message is then classified as unknown, and
                the only way for it to be officially classified as spam or not spam is via superuser review.

            <div class="description">
                We implemented Google authentication that either updates the current database or creates a new entry in the table. The login is secured
                with passport.js, and every future backend request from the time of the login is validated to ensure that only Zumper employees are allowed
                to make changes while using the application.
                <br><br>
                Although we set up authentication in this manner, we made it easy for the Zumper team to change the authentication to allow access to only
                Zumper emails when we handed over the final product.

                <strong>User Scoring</strong><br>
                For every user that uses this application, the quality of their activity on the platform is determined by an objectively determined user score
                that is simply calculated by taking the number of correct classifications that they make divided by the total number of messages they classified.
                <br>
                These user scores are continuously updated with every new message that is officially classified (i.e. when the both the bias threshold and minimum
                number of classifiers are met), and is immediately viewable by superusers as a column in the table listing all of the active users.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Superusers</strong><br>
                The Zumper spam classification app permits the assignment of <em>superusers</em>, which have a higher level of accessibility.
                Superusers are allowed to override the classification of any message that is displayed in the list of already categorized messages,
                as well as ascertain unknown classifications. With every change in classification, the user scoring is also adjusted accordingly, and both
                the changes in the categorization and the scoring is immediately visually updated in their respective tables.
                <br>
                Superusers are also able to both grant and revoke access to any regular user in the same user table.
