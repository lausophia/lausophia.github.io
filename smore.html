                s'more was a project conducted through UC Berkeley's professional entrepreneurship fraternity,
                <a href="http://www.ucberkeleysep.com">Sigma Eta Pi</a>, as a way to experience first-hand the process of
                developing a start-up venture from ideation to presentation.
                <br><br>
                I worked very closely with two of my pledge brothers, Nick Zhou and Gok√ße Guven, conducting a case study to
                identify a problem, propose a feasible solution, design a logo/brand, and prepare a pitch to present
                to <a href="https://thehouse.fund/">The House Fund</a>, all within the first 2 weeks of April 2019.
                <br><br>
                While all members contributed to s'mores's research and ideation, I lead the design-related components of
                the project (brand, logo, product prototype, pitch deck).

                Our venture zeroed in on researching and identifying the primary difficulties that immigrants and international
                students face when trying to culturally integrate into American society.
                <br><br>
                This focus stemmed from our team's common interest in languages, particularly the ways in which they may serve as
                barriers for foreigners to feel "at home" in a country other than their own, even if they have been studying or working
                there for several years.

                <strong>Name & Logo</strong>
                <br>
                The s'more is something that the typical, American born person would recognize immediately, having grown up either
                making it themselves, seen it in media, or having been exposed through friends. However, it is also something so niche
                to American culture, that it may be initially surprising to think that people from different backgrounds would have
                no idea what it is, let alone its role in American culture.
                <br><br>
                For this reason, we thought that it would be the perfect way to both encapsulate and differentiate our product's vision of
                facilitating the immersion experience.
                <br><br>
                <strong>UI/UX</strong>
                <br>
                For the product's UI/UX, I prioritized minimalism, taking much inspiration from interfaces that the average user would already most likely
                be familiar with, such as Pinterest's home page, Instagram's explore feed, Twitter's news highlights, and even UberEats'
                cuisine options.
                <br><br>
                We wanted to ensure that, due to this application's novelty, the user would need minimal onboarding or context
                of the app's purpose to be able to jump in and try it for his or herself.
