                Codedoor is a Glassdoor-inspired web application created specifically by the <em>mentored project team</em> for the
                members of Berkeley Codebase to share and learn from each other's job experiences and advice. This project was done during
                the Spring 2018 semester, and was composed of three subteams. Codedoor's development was mentored by our project managers,
                Brian Deleonardis and Andrew Chan. I worked most closely with William Zhou and Aidan Wang to create the Profiles
                component of the project.

                The members of Berkeley Codebase thrive from exchanging learning experiences and internship advice from each other, most typically
                through informal means â€“ Slack "recruiting" channel, Facebook Messenger group chats, and Google Spreadsheets. The difficulty that comes
                with this is the inability for members to refer to a consolidated pool of information, and thus the need to have the same conversation
                with each recruiting season.
                <br>
                The idea of Codedoor was created as a consequence of this <em>perceived need</em> for a formalized method to both <em>share</em> and <em>learn</em>
                from fellow members of the club without undergoing the primary pain-point of scrolling through disorganized chat archives and spreadsheets.

                <strong>Model Adaptation</strong>
                <br>
                Each team contributed to the creation of a primary model, of all which were maintained by internal databases. While some teams required the creation of a
                model from scratch, some adapted the Django built-in model by adding custom features pertaining to the needs of the app.
                For instance, the Profiles team incorporated Django's User Model functionality to add and edit the user's personal website, link to their
                LinkedIn profile, and professional resume.
                <br>
                Company profiles were created by importing an external database, while User profiles and reviews are created in the scope of the application.

                <strong>Search & Pagination</strong>
                <br>
                We implemented a fully functioning, auto-complete search bar, along with the ability to filter results based on specific categories,
                such as review, interview, company, and user and view results with the help of pagination to segment particularly large queries.

                <strong>Slack User Authentication</strong>
                <br>
                The profiles team utilized the Slack API for the primary method of user authentication, ensuring that the app's restriction to Berkeley
                Codebase members only. Thus, a valid current session is required for access to all parts of the website, given by tokens created by
                the application upon the user's login.
